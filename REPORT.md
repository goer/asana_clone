# Implementation Report

## Overview
- Completed full FastAPI backend per `docs/coding_tasks.md`, mirroring the PostgreSQL schema with SQLAlchemy models (`app/models`) and type-safe Pydantic v2 schemas (`app/schemas`).
- Implemented routers for auth, users, workspaces, projects, sections, tasks, comments, attachments, tags, teams, and custom fields, matching the OpenAPI contract and enforcing workspace membership + ownership checks.
- Centralised configuration (`app/core/config.py`), JWT/password utilities (`app/core/security.py`), and dependency helpers (`app/deps.py`). Entry point `app/main.py` wires all routers through `app/routers/__init__.py`.

## Database & Migrations
- `alembic/env.py` loads settings via `pydantic-settings`, exposing metadata from all models. First revision `alembic/versions/0001_initial_schema.py` creates every table, constraint, and index described in `docs/db_schema.md` (including join tables, custom field options, and EAV values).
- New data access helpers use eager loading (`selectinload`) so response payloads return nested owner/workspace data as required by the OpenAPI spec.

## Tooling & Operations
- Docker workflow: `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `.env`, and `docker-compose.yml` build/run API + Postgres; migrations applied with `docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head`. Stack verified and torn down during delivery.
- Added `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` (pytest, coverage, httpx, ruff). GitHub Actions pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) installs dev deps, runs `ruff check`, and executes the pytest suite with coverage reporting.

## Automated Testing
- Created SQLite-backed integration test harness (`tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_api.py`) overriding the DB dependency. End-to-end scenario covers registration/login, workspace/project/section/task lifecycles, nested task comments, attachments, tag assignment, team creation, and custom field definition/value setting.
- `pytest --maxfail=1` now passes locally (1 test, 24 warnings). Warnings stem from upstream deprecations (`pytest-asyncio` default scope, `httpx` shortcut, `python-jose` UTC helper). All critical flows validated programmatically in addition to prior manual curl checks.

## Follow-ups
- Consider adding workspace membership management endpoints and attachment upload storage if needed by future phases.
- Update `docker-compose.yml` to Compose v2 syntax to silence the “version attribute obsolete” warning.
- Optional: configure `ruff format`/`ruff check` rules in `pyproject.toml`, and expand pytest coverage (e.g., negative cases, tag listing assertions).
